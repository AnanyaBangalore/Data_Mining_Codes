# Data_Mining_Codes
My laboratory files for the Data Mining projects are located in this repository. The files were produced as part of my coursework and comprise source code, data sets, and output files.

Each lab file offers a brief summary of the project's goals and functionality and corresponds to a particular Data Mining topic or application. The subjects covered in the files, which are arranged according to lab sessions, include data preprocessing, clustering, classification, and association rule mining.

Documentation that gives a summary of the Data Mining concepts utilised and the outcomes is also included in the lab files. Anyone interested in data mining or wishing to increase their knowledge and proficiency in this field can use this documentation as a reference manual.
